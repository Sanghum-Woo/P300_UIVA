/// UIVA (Unity Indie VRPN Adapter) Unity
/// 
/// Function: The client side of UIVA living in Unity as a DLL file.
///           Unity creates a UIVA class and calls its GetXXXData(out X, out X) functions
///           to get the latest data from the sensor devices.
/// 
/// About UIVA:
/// 
///   UIVA is a middle-ware between VRPN and Unity. It enables games developed by Unity3D INDIE
///   to be controlled by devices powered by VRPN. It has a client and a server simultaneously.
///   For VRPN, UIVA is its client which implements several callback functions to receive the 
///   latest data from the devices. For Unity, UIVA is a server that stores the latest sensor
///   data which allows it to query. The framework is shown as below:

///      The VRPNWrapper implemented by the AR lab of Georgia Institute of Technology offers
///   a easier to use wrapper of VRPN to be used as a plugin in Unity3D Pro. If you can afford 
///   the Pro version of Unity. I suggest you to use VRPNWrapper. Their website is:
///           https://research.cc.gatech.edu/uart/content/about
///   They also implemented a ARToolkit wrapper which enables AR application in Unity. 
///   Check out their UART project, it is awesome!
